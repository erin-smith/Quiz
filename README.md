# Quiz
HW #4:   This a timed, multiple-choice JavaScript quiz that I wrote. The quiz utilizes event clicks, elements that disappear and reappear, hover, and overlay. It has a countdown timer with penalties for missing questions, utilizes local storage and inputs for the Highscores and Scoreboard.  It utilizes JavaScript that dynamically updates the HTML and CSS.  It is mobile-responsive and fun. The JavaScript utilizes fuctions, loops, conditionals, validations, array and string manipulation, Bootstrap, google fonts, jQuery, and timer elements.
